### Abstract
We study the female-oriented technologies (FemTech) ecosystem including regulations, IoT systems, mobile apps, and websites and reveal the exploitative patterns embedded in such systems due to the incompetent regulations. We advocate for the policymakers to explicitly acknowledge and accommodate the risks of these technologies in the relevant regulations.
