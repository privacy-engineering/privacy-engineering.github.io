### Abstract
The training of privacy engineers if often limited to the application of canonical PETs like differential privacy. However, the application of these PETs can often not be generalized. An effective privacy engineer must build solutions that applicable across all classes of products and cover every all elements of a product developments lifecycle. In this talk, I discuss building a privacy development lifecycle - with associated tools - by repurposing a security development lifecycle to scale privacy engineering.
