## About
Frequent data breaches, increased privacy non-compliance fines and rising user expectations of privacy have led organizations to focus on privacy as a core function and demonstrate compliance with existing (while preparing for upcoming) privacy laws. 

However, privacy programs driven by regulatory pressures result in a minimal, fast as possible,  ‘just enough to comply’ approach, without holistically addressing privacy.

To embed privacy into the software development and data life cycle, we turn to the emerging field of privacy engineering. We explore privacy engineering research to attempt answering questions such as - How are legal and policy privacy requirements translated to technical requirements? How can we address user’s privacy requirements and expectations? Which privacy engineering tools, models, standards and use cases are sufficient? What technical privacy assurances are available?

The Workshop on Privacy Engineering in Practice brings together researchers, lawyers, developers, practitioners, and industry experts to collaborate on building a stronger case for privacy engineering and moving away from the current industry practice of treating privacy as a compliance checkbox. We aim to find common ground between legal, technical, and design concepts for privacy.

## Workshop Goals
* Understand methods, tools, and approaches to design for privacy 
* Broaden the lens through which privacy compliance is viewed by industry and research community 
* Initiate discussions and collaboration among an interdisciplinary community of stakeholders to solve for current privacy engineering challenges
