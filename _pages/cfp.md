**Full Papers**

We are soliciting 4-5 page submissions (including references) on topics relating to authentication. Accepted submissions will be posted to the WAY workshop website (wayworkshop.org). We encourage participants to also make their workshop presentations available on the website. These submissions will not be considered “published” work, and as such, should not preclude publication elsewhere.

**Industry Reports**

We are looking for contributions from industry or public entities in the following form: a 1-2 page report together with a slide deck for a presentation of approx. 15 minutes. We do not want product pitches or slides from marketing/sales representatives. All submissions will be reviewed, and authors agree to revise their slides as needed.
